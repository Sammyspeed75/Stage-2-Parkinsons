# Stage-2-Parkinsons
**Parkinson‚Äôs disease** is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. It has 5 stages to it and affects approximately 1% of individuals older than 60 years . There is no cure for the disease. Although, most patients can maintain a good quality of life with medications. In some patients, surgery can help improve symptoms. 

**Parkinsons is characterised  by various symptoms** .

  # üìåGoal
The main goal of this project is to use Python Machine Learning to build a classification model which can accurately detect the presence of Parkinson‚Äôs disease in a patient‚Äôs body based on the various feature inputs used to train the model.

  <h1 align="center"> Data Set Information</h1>
  
  <h2 align="center"> This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 
31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a 
particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice 
recording from these individuals ("name" column). The main aim of the data 
is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to "status" 
column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD.

The data is in ASCII CSV format. The rows of the CSV file contain an 
instance corresponding to one voice recording. There are around six 
recordings per patient, the name of the patient is identified in the first 
column</h2>

<h1 align="center"> What is XGBoost?</h1>

XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library; this is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.

<h1 align="center"> üë©‚Äçüî¨üë©‚ÄçüíªWorkflow </h1>

We will use Google Colab Notebooks which is a popular data science tool to do our Model building. In this Python machine learning project, using the Python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, we will build a classification model using an XGBClassifier. The steps followed include: 

1. Load the dataset. 
2. Get the features and labels. 
3. Scale the features. 
4. Split the dataset build an XGBClassifierand
5. Calculate the accuracy of the model.


* Below are the libraries required to be imported.

  ```
  import pandas as pandas
  from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
  from xgboost import XGBClassifier
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score```
